Fix Apple Photos missing time when export. Your system language must be English. 
These scripts are fully generated by GPT-4o :(


1. Run "gettime.applescript" with "Script Editor" to export metadata.
   It generates a "photos_metadata.csv" on the desktop.

    
2. Install exiftool and pandas (assume you already install python)

    ```bash
    brew install exiftool
    pip install pandas
    ```
    
3. Use "mod_exif.py" to update EXIF
   Don't forget to change `csv_file` and `photo_directory` to your own path.
   Run python script:

    ```bash
    python ./update_exif.py
    ```
